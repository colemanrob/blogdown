## Estimating  the  Impact  of  Active  Labour  Market  Programs  using Administrative  Data  and  Matching  Methods

Handouyahia, 2016

* [research](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/conferences/symposium2016/program/14740-eng.pdf) link
* using admin data matched to CRA they find that EBSMs have positive effects on employment and earnings

### Findings
* EBSMs caused gains in employment earnings, incidence of employment (+2.4% first year to +4.4% by fifth year) and reduction of EI benefits after completing
* SD had most pronounced effect (between $204 and $4,059 higher)
* SD represents the largest incremental gains


## Labour  market  program  efficacy: Evidence  from  Ontario  Works

Adams et. al. 2018

* working paper [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oyv8dqucbh5rhtw/Ontario_works.pdf?dl=0) and cd howe report [here](https://www.cdhowe.org/public-policy-research/assessing-active-labour-market-programs-how-effective-ontario-works)
* how effective are OW ALMPs on two outcomes:
	* case duration (benefit 'spell' measured in months)
	* probability of returning to OW within 1 or 2 years of exit
* this client group has weaker LM attachment and so not perfectly aligned to existing literature on ALMPs
* accordingly existing canadian work suggests this group is differentially affected by ALMPs

### Findings
* placement services extend OW spells by 16 months
* structured job search not having an effect on 'return'
* training programs (literacy, skills/vocational) does reduce 'return' by 07% year 1 and 1.1% year 2
* among all interventions there's a trade-off between short and long term effectiveness 
	* placement means longer spells but reduces _P(return)_ by 7% in year 1 and 10% year 2
	* structured job search reduces spell by 1.5 - 3 months but doesn't affect _P(return)_
	* training program alone is more effective in the short-term than assignment to boht training program and structured job-search (implying the interventions aren't additive)
