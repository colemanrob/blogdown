## Targeting labour market programmes — results from a randomized experiment
Stefanie Behncke, Markus Frölich & Michael Lechner, 2009

[This research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03399281) distinguishes between two types of statisical approaches to resource allocation in [ALMPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_labour_market_policies):
  * _targeting_ which selects for each client the program with the highest expected outcome (based in the impact effect of each type of intervention), and;
  * _profiling_ which based on a set of client characteristics, estimates the risk of becoming long term unemployed where those at the highest risk of being unemployed are assigned to the most intensive services
  
The authors suggest that targeting is preferable to profiling when:
  1. there are a variety of types of programs/interventions offered, and/or;
  2. the risk of long-term unemployed is not highly correlated with program impacts

The authors detail the challenges of maximizing the allocation of ALMPs in practice - namely:
* moral hazard of employment agencies (*contracting challenge*, more on this [here](https://robcoleman.ca/notes/notes-on-moral-hazard/))
  * caseworkers have their own goals for clients (e.g. improving personal situation, long-term stability rather than rapid re-integration)
* caseworker prediction (*informational challenge*)
  * small sample sizes to build intuition on what works (no view of the system)
  * no systematic evidence of outcomes/success (e.g. clients maye return but to a difference provider/caseworker)
  
The authors review a pilot study in Switzerland where PES caseworkers were randomized into 2 groups, one who had access to statistical targeting tools and one where no prediction support was offered.  The design was robust:
* randomization at the caseworker level
* 1 year study from 2005 to 2006
* over 18k jobseekers in the prediction group

The conclusions were as follows:
* the statistical predictions offered had no impact on program assignment
* caseworkers made their own predictions and ignored the model
* incentives are required when caseworker discretion is at odds with the model


## Evaluating Profiling as a Means of Allocating Government Services
Berger, Black and Smith, 2000

[This research](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/economicsresrpt/356/) considers how to evaluate statistical profiling methods in allocation mechanisms for government programs.
