# Moral hazard in ALMPs

Bruttel, Oliver 2005

* [This research](https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/44013) reviews the mechanisms by which government can manage the risks (moral hazard) associated with contracting out of ALMPs using a [principal-agent theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem) lens.
* the author solves for the risks by advancing an integrated governance approach using 3 distinct governance mechanisms
  *	incentives
  *	information
  *	control 
* reviews 3 countries (UK, Netherlands, Australia)

### Principal-agent theory and moral hazard
* concerned with how does govt (principal) ensure that service providers (agents) act in the govts interest 
* main risk is _moral hazard_ where agents act in their own interest (maximising utility, risk avoidance etc) where principal cannot observe their actions
* moral hazard in ALMPs revolve around 3 key areas:
   * creaming - selecting only optimal clients for service
   * parking - not serving clients with low success probability
   * dead-weight - serving clients who would have otherwise been successful without intervention (not explicitly mentioned but described elsewhere)

### 1. Incentive mechanisms
* outcomes-based payments
* split-fee works best (fixed & outcomes) rather than threshold based (like US) so that award function is linear
* measured as outputs (outcomes at 13 and 26 weeks are standard) rather than inputs (clients served)
* should optimize around under-investment i.e. skills training like Job Seeker Account (matching govt investment)
* common strategy to avoid moral hazard problems is to organize outcomes payments by client groups based on assessment tool (e.g. JSCI in AUS and Kansmeter in Netherlands)

### 2 . Information mechanisms
* benchmarking - measure relative performance of providers
	* 2 types of variables:  context (regional/local labour market) and jobseeker characteristics (age, duration of unemployment, skills etc)
	* Australia 5 Star model gold standard - best 60% of providers are offered contract renewal without tender
* monitoring - mix of database inputs and in-person
	* overcome blackbox problem
	* irregularities flagged automatically

### 3. Control mechanisms
* rules and regulations (guidelines, eligibility, etc)
* quality management frameworks
	* set minimum standard of service
* tied to monitoring and benchmarking

### Special expertise 
* identifies 3 types of capacities governments need
	* feasibility assessment capacity - _make-or-buy_ decisions about services
	* Implementation capacity (*incentive mechanisms*) tenders, selecting providers, negotiate contracts etc
	* evaluation capacity (*information and control*) - evaluate and monitor the performance of providers

## Institutional moral hazard in Australia PES

F Vandenbroucke, C Luigjes, 2016

* [This research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2782375) outlines how Austrialia moved from a _blackbox_ approach to contracting out employment services towards a regime of minimum requirements and monitoring

* reforms of the blackbox approach included:
	* new tendering processes (see above)
	* 5 Star rating system for providers
	* adjustment of provider responsibilities
	* standardization of work process

* relationship between govt & providers has been rocky as flexibility has been reduced

* problems were creaming and parking

* 3 streams of service
	* stream A - job competitive
	* stream B - vocational issues
	* stream C - series non-vocational issues via referral

* Denmark devolved employment services to municipalities
* Work for the Dole targets long term barriered clients in an attempt to overcome parking (re-vamp of JCP?)
* the KPIs, outcomes based model also includes a bonus if referred to training
* outcomes are based on location, stream and expediency (how fast) clients move to outcomes.
