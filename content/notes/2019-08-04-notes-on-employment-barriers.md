Rodrigo Fernandezi, Herwig Immervolli, Daniele Pacificoi and Céline Thévenoti, 2016

* [this research](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/faces-of-joblessness_5jlwvz47xptj-en?crawler=true) advances new methods to categorize employment barriers among jobseekers so as to design appropriately tailored activation responses across policy and institutional domains.
* little is known about specific employment barriers at the individual level, instead broad proxies are used to describe populations (NEET, older workers etc)
* instead the authors try a _bottom up_ approach by categorizing and measuring employment barriers
* using _latest class analysis_ (LDA), a clustering method, the authors find more useful groups of jobseekers who share common employment barriers by analyzing the European Union Statisitcs on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) [available here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-statistics-on-income-and-living-conditions) 


### Types of Employment Barriers
* lack of work-relateed capabilities
	* a range of factors that may limit an individuals' capacity to perform a specific task (e.g. lack of educations, skills or work experience, care responsibilities, or health limitations)
* lack of work incentives
	* weak incentives to look for or accept a good job - (e.g. low pay, generous out of work benefits)
* lack of employment opportunities (regional)
	* a small number of vacancies in the labour market segment due to information asymmetries, skills mismatches, discrimination
