* [this research](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/how-demanding-are-activation-requirements-for-jobseekers_2bdfecca-en) evaluates the strictness of rules (eligibility criteria) that govern the receipt of benefits (first-tier/unemployment and second-tier/welfare) across OECD countries
* they establish what types of eligibility criteria are common across countries 
* they surveyed each OECD country and derived a quantitative policy indicator of eligibility strictness of each scheme
* they discuss the impacts of the eligibility choices on first and second tier benefits (for Canada, they used Ontario Works) and marginally discuss administrative provisions (how clients interact with administration)


### Eligibility Criteria
* **entitlement conditions**: these are the rules set by the feds over which Ontario has little influence (e.g. how many hours of work before claim is established)
* **activity conditions** - behavioural requirements that must be met by those who have an established right ('entitlement')
	* availability criteria
		* availability during ALMP participation (excuse for training/participation)
		* occupational mobility - refuse based on NOC/less pay
		* geography
		* other valid reasons - canada only labour dispute
	* job-search and reporting criteria
		* frequency of job-search activity
		* documentation of job-search
	* sanctions for non-compliance
		* voluntary resignation / quit
		* refusal of suitable employment
		* repeated refusal of employment
		* refusal of ALMP participation
		* repeated refusal of ALMP participation
 
## First Tier eligibility criteria
* job search & reporting criteria vary strongly but availability criteria varies little to none
	* australia - job search now once a month and Denmark is entirely online
	* Canada among lowest for job-search and reporting requirements

## Second Tier criteria
* availability criteria represent biggest difference between first and second tier benefit types
* two types of jurisdictions - 1 where SA clients don't qualify (see Germany) and could be Canada and 2 - where rules are mostly identical - see UK's jobseekers allowance
* rules are often less strict here to give local authorities more leeway to design appropriate solutions
	
## Insights
* warnings and sanctions generally are shown to shorten benefit duration and increase re-employment among those who may expect to incur a sanction (threat effects work)
* soft constraints like mandatory participation in AMLPs or gradual reductions of benefits levels over time have similar effects to those of harsher instruments like sanctions and dis-entitlements
* goal is to strengthen incentives to look/prepare for and accept employment and also target those more suitable
