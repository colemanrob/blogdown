## Philosophy of Science

* McElreath offers good insights on the philosophy of science and calls for _statistical rethinking_
* statistical models are like the golum of prague, unthinking instruction followers.
  * bad/poor instructions will destroy Prague
  * bad/poor models will compute but not tell us anything
<p>

## Bayesian Toolkit

* instead we need a broader toolkit to build models and understand the causes:
  1. Bayesian data analysis -- counting the number of ways the data could have happened given our assumptions
  2. Model comparison -- using cross-validation and information criteria to compare models predictions
  3. Multi-level models -- accounting for unmeasured aspects of individuals, groups, or populations.
  4. Graphical causal models -- designing models for the purposes of _identifying_ causes
