I make notes about how to solve problems using [r](https://www.r-project.org/), an open-source programming language for data science.  Also interested in [active labour market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_labour_market_policies) policy, [search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_theory) and [matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory_(economics)) theory, and jobs data. 

I live in the northern part of Ontario, Canada with [this furry brown monster](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYMVFDqjQw6/).  I write these notes to learn out loud, keep a second searchable brain, and improve my thinking/writing. :books: :coffee: :bike: :computer:
