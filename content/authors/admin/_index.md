I think about how to solve problems using [r](https://www.r-project.org/), an open-source programming language for data science.  At work I think about [active labour market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_labour_market_policies) policy, [matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory_(economics)) theory, and jobs data for [#ONTatwork](https://twitter.com/ONTatwork).
